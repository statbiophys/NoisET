# Mods

- Noise model with constructor that imports the data builds sparse repr.
- Data can be a 2d list of counts or a Dataframe having two columns "counts1", "counts2".
- The default labels "Clone_count" are substituted with "counts" wherever they appear, 
for the sake of keeping the notation general and not immunology-specific.
- The Data_Process class does not ask anymore for the clone fractions and sequences, 
which are never used in the analysis (readme and examples modified accordingly).
- All the internal methods used only for computation of Noise and Expansion model are now private.
- The sparse representation is now a class variable and is removed from all the arguments 
of the class functions.
- Added option for choosing or not to print the found parameters to file.
- Added option verbose for printing info during the algorithm.
- Added default initial parameters for each model.
- Common functions between classes are defined in a utility file.
- Expansion_model constructor imports data and builds sparse repr.
- Expansion model has some internal vars to reduce n arguments.
- expansion_table in Expansion model now return the final table instead of printing it
to file
